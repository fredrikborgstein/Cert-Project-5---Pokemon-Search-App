# Cert-Project-5---Pokemon-Search-App

This is the fifth of five projects to earn the FreeCodeCam certification for Javascript: Algorithms and Data Structures.

As part of the project, we were given an API, where we could async fetch the data, based upon an input value, in an input field on our site. 
The output had to match the criteria for the project on FreeCodeCamp, such as displaying the types, stats, names, and images.

This project is made completely with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.
